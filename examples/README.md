# Lualite Examples

All of the examples in this directory can be run with:

```sh
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

The [rust-toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is needed to compile
and run Rust code.  Because of this, some of the examples have their output recorded
in a readme file so the output can be seen without needing a compiler.
